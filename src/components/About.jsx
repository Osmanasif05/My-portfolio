        Hi, I’m Osman Asif, a Mechatronics Engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan
        University pursuing a Minor in Computer Science focusing on mechanical design,
        robotics, embedded systems, and computer vision.
        <br /><br />
        I love taking ideas from rough sketches to fully engineered CAD assemblies,
        thinking through tolerances, manufacturability, and mechanical function.
